Xamarin-iOS-LockScreenAudio
===========================

A sample Xamarin.iOS app that loads the music from the user's media library into a list view. Selecting a song from the list view loads the song into the detail view, starts playing it, and also loads all of that artists songs into the media player queue, in the same order as in the list view. Once the song is playing, song information is displayed on the lock screen and on the control panel (swipe up from bottom), and you can use the controls on the lock and control screens to control the audio queue, even going back a track which turned out to be less trivial than one would think. :-)
